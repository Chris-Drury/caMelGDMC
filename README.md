# Welcome to the MineCraft AI Competition Repo
Here you will find information about how to build artificial intelligence for minecraft.

## First steps
1. Download mcedit-unified here: https://www.mcedit-unified.net/ The mcedit framework is used to run the competition. A map will be loaded, your algorithm will be run as it will be contained within an mcedit filter file, and it will then be scored by judges.
2. Visit our wiki page to learn how to build a plugin and see valuable information about useful methods included in the mcedit libraries. Look at some of our examples too!
